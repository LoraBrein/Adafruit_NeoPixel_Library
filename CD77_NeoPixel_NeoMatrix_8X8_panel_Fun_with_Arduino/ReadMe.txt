NeoPixel-NeoMatrix-8X8-Panel-Fun-with-Arduino

This sketch runs on an Adafruit NeoPixel NeoMatrix 8X8 panel and on an Arduino Nano or on an Arduino Uno.

It uses arrays and arrays of arrays with more new functions to have some blinky fun with the panel.

It is powered by a 5 volt power supply with a 4700 mfd 35 volt despiking capacitor.

There is the two resistor protection circuit (see https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=50434&p=254414&hilit=ws2812.jpg#p254414 and look for ws2812.jpeg) between the power supply and the panel.

ENJOY!
